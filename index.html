          <p>All college services are available. Please understand that because of the changing nature of COVID-19 and Illinois&rsquo; Reopening Plan, this information may change without notice. If you don&rsquo;t see what you are looking for&mdash;or would like more information&mdash;please <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a>.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Vaccination and testing</h5>
          <p>KCC complies with Gov. Pritzker's vaccine and mask requirements, first announced on Aug. 26, 2021. It applies to those who are inside a college facility for more than 15 minutes at least once a week on a regular basis, including students and employees.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h4">Vaccination policy / Free class for vaccinated students</h4>
          <p>The <a href="https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/faq/">FAQ page</a> has a special section dedicated to questions about the vaccination policy.</p>
          <ul class="mb-0">
            <li>If you are already vaccinated, complete KCC&rsquo;s verification form online. This is a one-time verification.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-center"><a class="btn btn-lg mt-1 btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://form.jotform.com/212384579044965">Vaccination Verification Form</a></p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you are not already vaccinated, consider making plans to receive the first dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination series or a single-dose vaccination. Second doses of the vaccine must be received within 30 days after the first dose.</li>
            <li>Most KCC students who are vaccinated qualify for a free class from KCC. This is up to $495 which will be a credit on your account. <a href="https://news.kcc.edu/2021/08/02/vaccinated-claim-a-free-class.html">Read all details here</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="typography__h4">Weekly COVID-19 tests</h4>
          <p>If you have not received a COVID-19 vaccine, you must be tested for COVID-19 once per week in order to visit a KCC facility. If you do not do a COVID-19 test at KCC, you are still required to get tested elsewhere. The deadline to submit results is 11:59 p.m. each Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
