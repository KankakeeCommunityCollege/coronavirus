          <h3 class="typography__h3">Message to KCC students - Classes continue online through spring</h3>
          <p><strong>POSTED ON: 03/20/20</strong></p>
          <p>Editor's note:</p>
          <p>KCC is following the shelter-in-place proclamation and our facilities will remain closed until the order is lifted.</p>
          <p>Students:</p>
          <p>As conditions continue to evolve, and cautionary measures remain necessary, Kankakee Community College will continue with online classes through the conclusion of the Spring 2020 semester (May 14). This is later than the April 20 date communicated last week. This effort is to continue the college&rsquo;s commitment to reducing potential pathways for community spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
          <p>Each professor/instructor will continue to communicate with their students through Canvas - the online learning environment. Classes and support services, such as the library and tutoring, will continue to be available online.</p>
          <p>Adult Education and GED preparation courses are suspended through the end of Spring 2020 semester. Continuing Education offerings are canceled with the exception of its online offerings.</p>
          <p>KCC facilities remain closed through March 30. The facilities closure includes the Riverfront Campus and Manufacturing and Industrial Technology Center in Kankakee, the North Extension Center in Bradley, and the South Extension Center in Watseka.</p>
          <p>KCC will update <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/">coronavirus.kcc.edu</a> as the main source of information for our college&rsquo;s actions and response.</p>
          <p>The health and safety of our faculty, staff, students and community is a priority. The college&rsquo;s administration will continue to monitor the state&rsquo;s recommendations and consult with public health authorities.</p>
          <p>This is hard. It cannot be denied. KCC is committed to providing the high level of instructional rigor, service and support that you have come to expect. We just need to work together, course-by-course and sometimes person-by-person. It may take some time to adjust to Canvas and online learning if you&rsquo;re new to it, but we are here for you. Please let us know how we can help you be as successful as possible in your courses.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <p>Dr. Michael Boyd</p>
