          <h3 class="typography__h3">Message to students regarding coronavirus</h3>
          <p><strong>POSTED ON: 03/12/20</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A message to KCC students</strong></p>
          <p>Kankakee Community College will extend its spring break until March 22, and most face-to-face instruction will move online March 23. This action is to reduce potential pathways for community spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

          <p><strong>This is not a college closure.</strong></p>

          <p>There will be no classes in any format from March 16-22 to allow faculty, staff and students to make the adjustment to online delivery. Beginning on March 23 through April 20 faculty will teach lecture classes online. Each professor/instructor will communicate with their students regarding how their specific classes will proceed in an online environment. Some labs will continue to meet in person. Clinicals will continue as allowed by the host site.</p>

          <p>If you’re nervous about taking classes in an online environment, or you don’t have the technology or internet connectivity you need, talk to your advisor next week. Should you need it, Information Technology Services and the ITS Help Desk can provide <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/students/helpful/it/Pages/helpdesk.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support for online technologies</a>.</p>

          <p>KCC’s Riverfront Campus and its extension sites will remain open. Student support services like tutoring, advising, registration, food pantry, computer labs, and campus resources are still available. While on campus, please practice social distancing guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control defines social distancing as "remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet) from others when possible."</p>



          <p>KCC will update <a href="https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coronavirus.kcc.edu</a> as the main source of information for our college’s actions and response.</p>



          <p>I realize this is a major disruption of academics. I’ve made these decisions with all the current information available from the <a href="http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois Department of Public Health</a>, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centers for Disease Control</a>, and in consultation with other Illinois community college presidents, KCC’s administrative and faculty leadership teams. I feel it is the best way to minimize the risk of spreading the virus. It is my hope that temporarily moving to the online environment will minimize the spread of the virus, while still pursuing our educational mission.</p>

          <p><strong>Other immediate effects</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>College-sponsored student travel is suspended, with limited exceptions for intercollegiate athletics. At these events, only the athletes and coaches may be present.</li>
            <li>Events at KCC with 50 or more anticipated attendees are postponed at least through April 20. All gatherings should practice social distancing guidelines.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>As we continue to monitor the situation, we may need to take additional steps. On or before April 20, the college will consult with public health authorities regarding conditions and the possibility of resuming face-to-face instruction. Looking forward, if significant events such as Commencement are going to be affected, we will communicate as far in advance as possible. As of today, we don’t have enough information to make those decisions.</p>



          <p>We will get through this together. I would like to thank students for your flexibility. This is not easy, and your commitment to persevere is appreciated. To faculty, thank you for your deep care in making adjustments to maintain academic quality and accommodate our students' needs. As we work through this unprecedented situation, our propensity to be flexible and work together has made a difference.</p>

          <p>Sincerely,</p>



          <p>Dr. Michael Boyd<br>
            KCC President</p>

          <p><strong>POSTED ON: 03/11/20</strong></p>
          <p>This is a message emailed this morning to students from KCC's vice president for student affairs.</p>
          <p>Dear Students:</p>
          <p>The college is closely observing developments of the coronavirus (COVID 19) outbreak, both locally and nationally. We are watching information from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) and the <a href="http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois Department of Public Health</a> for updates and official information. As we are sure you understand, the outbreak and its consequences are continuously changing.</p>

          <div class="collapse" id="collapseMessage">
            <p>At this time, we do not know of any coronavirus cases within the KCC community. The ability of the college to maintain a healthy environment is a partnership among our faculty, staff, students and visitors. It remains very important to continue common-sense precautions and actions recommended by the CDC as defenses against coronavirus and other viruses and respiratory illnesses, including the flu:</p>
            <p>CDC Recommendations</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Stay home if you’re sick;</li>
              <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick;</li>
              <li>Cover coughs and sneezes;</li>
              <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces;</li>
              <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds – an alcohol-based hand sanitizer can be used when soap and water are not available; and</li>
              <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, if you are returning from China, Iran, Italy, Japan, or South Korea - countries with an <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alert level of 2 or 3</a> designated by the CDC - please self-monitor for coughing, difficulty breathing and fever by taking your temperature twice per day for at least 14 days. During that time, you should stay home and limit interactions with others as much as possible. If you traveled to a country with a widespread coronavirus outbreak (again, level 2 or 3 designated by the CDC), the college may consider options to study from home for two-weeks (until March 27) upon request. Email me at <a href="mailto:jdasilva@kcc.edu">jdasilva@kcc.edu</a> to learn more.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your diligence and care.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Dr. Jose daSilva<br>
              Vice President for Student Affairs</p>
