          <p>All college services are available. Please understand that because of the changing nature of COVID-19 and Illinois&rsquo; Reopening Plan, this information may change without notice. If you don&rsquo;t see what you are looking for&mdash;or would like more information&mdash;please <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a>.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h4">Vaccination policy</h4>
          <p>KCC complies with vaccine and mask requirements from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/community-guidance/vaccination-requirements.html#:~:text=Who%20is%20required%20to%20get,required%20to%20be%20fully%20vaccinated.">state of Illinois</a> and other governmental agencies, as appropriate. The vaccination policy applies to those who are inside a college facility for more than 15 minutes at least once a week on a regular basis, including students and employees.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/faq/">FAQ page</a> has a special section dedicated to questions about the vaccination policy.</p>
          <ul class="mb-0">
            <li>If you are already vaccinated, complete KCC&rsquo;s verification form online. This is a one-time verification.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-center"><a class="btn btn-lg mt-1 btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://form.jotform.com/212384579044965">Vaccination Verification Form</a></p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you are not already vaccinated, consider making plans to receive the first dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination series or a single-dose vaccination. Second doses of the vaccine must be received within 30 days after the first dose.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5 class="typography-h5">Weekly COVID-19 tests</h5>
          <p>If you have not received a COVID-19 vaccine, you must be tested for COVID-19 once per week in order to visit a KCC facility. The deadline to submit results is 11:59 p.m. each Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
          <ul class="mb-1">
            <li>The final day to use SHIELD Testing at KCC is July 13.</li>
            <li>Walk-ins and appointments are both welcome. The location is the second floor of the D building, in the hallway East of the Student Affairs entrance (Room D222). You can also ask for directions at the Student Affairs reception desk.</li>

            <li>Masks are optional for everyone, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Maintain physical distancing while utilizing services and common areas at the college.</li>
            <li>Follow all instructions on posted signage and from staff.</li>
            <li>Classes are offered in-person, online and a hybrid (some online, some in-person). The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.kcc.edu/schedule">class schedule</a> has details on how the class is being offered.</li>

          <h5 class="typography-h5">Coming to KCC after COVID-19 diagnosis or exposure</h5>
          <p>As recommended by the Kankakee County Health Department, KCC is following the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html">Center for Disease Control</a>&nbsp;quarantine and isolation instructions:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you test positive for COVID-19, isolate for 5 days after onset of symptoms, or 5 days from specimen collection date if no symptoms are present. Day 0 is the first day of symptoms or specimen collection date if asymptomatic. If you continue to have fever or other symptoms, or have not improved after 5 days of isolation, do not end isolation until you are fever-free for 24 hours and your other symptoms have improved.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Continue to wear a well-fitted mask around others for 5 additional days after release from isolation. If unable to wear a mask when around others, continue to isolate for a total of 10 days.&nbsp;<ul>
                <li>Avoid being around students or staff who are immunocompromised or at high risk for severe disease.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>If masks need to be removed (e.g., for lunch), ensure 6 feet of physical distancing until 10 days after symptom onset or positive test.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
