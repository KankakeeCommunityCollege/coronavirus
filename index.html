          <ul>
            <li>If you test positive for COVID-19, isolate for 5 days after onset of symptoms, or 5 days from specimen collection date if no symptoms are present. Day 0 is the first day of symptoms or specimen collection date if asymptomatic.

            <li>Continue to wear a well-fitted mask around others for 5 additional days after release from isolation. If unable to wear a mask when around others, continue to isolate for a total of 10 days.&nbsp;<ul>
                <li>Avoid being around students or staff who are immunocompromised or at high risk for severe disease.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>If masks need to be removed (e.g., for lunch), ensure 6 feet of physical distancing until 10 days after symptom onset or positive test.&nbsp;</li>
