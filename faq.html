          <p>These questions and answers are specific to KCC. For information about coronavirus, please visit the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Is campus open?</h5>
          <p>The college is transitioning carefully, and as of mid-August, all facilities are open on a limited basis. Masks are required.

All services are also online, including support services like tutoring, advising, registration, and counseling.

          <h5 class="typography__h5">Are fall classes online or in-person?</h5>
          <p>There are still Fall 2020 classes that haven't started yet. Some are in-person, some are online only, and some are a "hybrid" of both. It depends on the content of the class. Most labs and other "hands-on" classes will be in-person with appropriate procedures to keep everyone healthy. Most lecture classes will be online. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.kcc.edu/schedule">class schedule</a> has details on how the class is being offered.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">What if I don't know how to take classes online?</h5>
          <p>You can take an orientation course to learn about Canvas, the learning management system (LMS) used for KCC's online, hybrid and enhanced face-to-face courses. You will log in to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kcc.instructure.com/">Canvas</a> using your KCC username and password. When you log in for the first time, you will see an invitation to take the Canvas student orientation course. You can click on the announcement or the Help link in the lower left corner of the Canvas screen at any time to enroll.</p>
          <h5 class="typography-h5">Will lab and technology fees still be charged when they are delivered online?</h5>
          <p>Yes, lab and technology fees will be charged because the college still incurs a cost to present coursework &mdash; whether it is in person or through remote learning.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Are college events affected?</h5>
          <p>The college&nbsp; is following Illinois' re-opening guidelines regarding events. To see what is coming up, both virtual and in-person, visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://news.kcc.edu/events">news.kcc.edu/events</a>.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Is college-related travel affected?</h5>
          <p>All college-sponsored, non-essential travel is suspended until further notice.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Are counseling services still available to KCC students?</h5>
          <p>Yes, Transformative Growth Counselors are available. &nbsp;Call 630-423-6010 or visit the website <a target="_blank" href="http://www.transformativegrowth.org">www.transformativegrowth.org</a>. Tell them you are a KCC student.</p>
