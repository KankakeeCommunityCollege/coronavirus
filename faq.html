          <h5 class="typography__h5">What if I don't know how to take classes online?</h5>
          <p class="present-before-paste">You can take an orientation course to learn about Canvas, the learning management system (LMS) used for KCC's online, hybrid and enhanced face-to-face courses. You will log in to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kcc.instructure.com/">Canvas</a> using your KCC username and password. When you log in for the first time, you will see an invitation to take the Canvas's student orientation course.

          <h5 class="typography__h5">Are college events affected?</h5>
          <p class="present-before-paste">Yes, the college has canceled or postponed all events until the Illinois' &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo; order is lifted. KCC employees who are the event organizers are responsible for informing guests and attendees that their event has been postponed or canceled. This includes KCC events at off-campus venues.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Will spring semester be a week longer because of the extended spring break?</h5>

          <p class="present-before-paste">Your professor/instructor will contact you regarding how your class will continue. Most will move to an online format. Clinicals will continue as allowed by the host site. Remote instruction is planned through the end of the Spring 2020 semester.</p>

          <p>Yes, lab and technology fees will be assessed for summer classes because the college still incurs a cost to present coursework and assignments through remote learning.</p>
