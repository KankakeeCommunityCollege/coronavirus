          <h2 class="typography__h2">FAQ</h2>
          <p>These questions and answers are specific to KCC. For information about coronavirus, please visit the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>
          <h3 class="typography-h3">Vaccination &amp; testing policy questions</h3>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Who has to be vaccinated to visit KCC?</h4>
          <p>Those who are inside a college facility for more than 15 minutes at least once a week on a regular basis, including students and employees, must provide proof of vaccination. Not included: Individuals who complete their coursework exclusively remotely. This policy is due to an order by Illinois' governor, and went into effect Sept. 19, 2021.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">What if I do not want to be vaccinated (or cannot) due to medical or other reasons?</h4>
          <p>If you do not receive the vaccine, you must be tested for COVID-19 at least once per week. Check your KCC email for the link to submit results. You must submit results every week by Saturday at 11:59 p.m. Home tests are acceptable, and some other locations which offer testing are&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/testing.html">listed on this site</a>.&nbsp;</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">What is KCC's mask policy?</h4>
          <p>Masks are optional for everyone, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.&nbsp;</p>
          <h5 class="typography-h5">Where can I find COVID-19 testing and/or vaccination sites?</h5>
          <p>The COVID-19 Resources page has links to help, including testing locations <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid-19-testing-sites">throughout Illinois</a> and in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kankakeehealth.org/covid-19-response-and-recovery/covid-19-testing-locations/">Kankakee County</a>; and a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vaccines.gov/search/">searchable database of vaccination locations</a>.</p>
          <h3 class="typography-h3">General questions</h3>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Is campus open?</h4>
          <p>All college facilities are open.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Every weekday students should complete a self-assessment. The self-assessment is at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://certify.kcc.edu">certify.kcc.edu</a>.</li>
            <li>Masks are optional for everyone in indoor public spaces, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.</li>
            <li>New and returning students can phone 815-802-8500 (Mon. - Fri. 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.) and an advisor will call back within two business days; or submit the&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/zqf5EsV519nB5ukg8">Advising Call Request Form</a>.</li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span>Returning students can schedule an&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://kccadvising.setmore.com/">in-person appointment</a>&nbsp;for a specific day or time.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>General questions can be emailed to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:advising@kcc.edu">advising@kcc.edu</a>.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Are classes online or in-person?</h4>
          <p>For the most part, KCC is back to it's normal schedule. In-person, online and a "hybrid" of both are offered. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.kcc.edu/schedule">class schedule</a> has details on how each class is being offered.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Where do I ask questions about taking classes online?</h4>
          <p>Canvas is the learning management system used for KCC's online, hybrid and enhanced face-to-face courses. To learn how a course using Canvas works: log in to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kcc.instructure.com/">Canvas</a> using your KCC username and password. When you log in for the first time, there is an invitation to take the Canvas student orientation course. Click on the announcement or the Help link in the lower left corner of the Canvas screen at any time to enroll.</p>
          <p>Also note, lab and technology fees are the same for online and in-person classes because the college still incurs a cost to present coursework &mdash; whether it is in person or through remote learning.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">I was diagnosed&mdash;or had COVID-19 symptoms. When can I return to classes?</h4>
          <p>Please complete a <a href="https://certify.kcc.edu">certify.kcc.edu</a> form to inform the college about your status and to start the communication process with your professors. As recommended by the Kankakee County Health Department, KCC is following the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html">Center for Disease Control</a>&nbsp;quarantine and isolation instructions:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you test positive for COVID-19, isolate for 5 days after onset of symptoms, or 5 days from specimen collection date if no symptoms are present. Day 0 is the first day of symptoms or specimen collection date if asymptomatic. If you continue to have fever or other symptoms, or have not improved after 5 days of isolation, do not end isolation until you are fever-free for 24 hours and your other symptoms have improved.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Continue to wear a well-fitted mask around others for 5 additional days after release from isolation. If unable to wear a mask when around others, continue to isolate for a total of 10 days.&nbsp;<ul>
                <li>Avoid being around students or staff who are immunocompromised or at high risk for severe disease.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>If masks need to be removed (e.g., for lunch), ensure 6 feet of physical distancing until 10 days after symptom onset or positive test.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Are counseling services still available to KCC students?</h4>
          <p>Yes, Transformative Growth Counselors are available. Call 630-423-6010 or visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.transformativegrowth.org">www.transformativegrowth.org</a>. Tell them you are a KCC student.</p>
