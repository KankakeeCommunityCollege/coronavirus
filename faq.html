          <h5 class="typography__h5">Are classes online or in-person?</h5>
          <p>For the most part, KCC will is back to it's normal schedule. In-person, online and a "hybrid" of both are being offered. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.kcc.edu/schedule">class schedule</a> has details on how each class is being offered.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Where do I ask questions about taking classes online?</h5>
          <p>Canvas is the learning management system used for KCC's online, hybrid and enhanced face-to-face courses. To learn how a course using Canvas works: log in to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kcc.instructure.com/">Canvas</a> using your KCC username and password. When you log in for the first time, there is an invitation to take the Canvas student orientation course. Click on the announcement or the Help link in the lower left corner of the Canvas screen at any time to enroll.</p>
          <p>Also note, lab and technology fees are the same for online and in-person classes because the college still incurs a cost to present coursework &mdash; whether it is in person or through remote learning.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Are counseling services still available to KCC students?</h5>
          <p>Yes, Transformative Growth Counselors are available. &nbsp;Call 630-423-6010 or visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.transformativegrowth.org">www.transformativegrowth.org</a>. Tell them you are a KCC student.</p>
