          <p>These questions and answers are specific to KCC. For information about coronavirus, please visit the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Is campus open?</h5>
          <p>The college is transitioning carefully, and so (as of June 15), some facilities are open on a limited basis, and by appointment only. Masks are required. A <a target="_blank" href="https://certify.kcc.edu/">self-assessment</a> is also required for every person who enters the building. All services remain online, including support services like tutoring, advising, registration, and counseling. To learn if the service you want is available, phone or email the appropriate department, or submit a <a href="https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/contact-us/">contact us</a> form.</p>

          <h5 class="typography__h5">Will fall classes be online or in-person?</h5>
          <p>It depends on the content of the class. Most labs and other "hands-on" classes will be in-person with appropriate procedures to keep everyone healthy. Most lecture classes will be online. The class schedule will say how the class is being offered.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">What if I don't know how to take classes online?</h5>
          <p>You can take an orientation course to learn about Canvas, the learning management system (LMS) used for KCC's online, hybrid and enhanced face-to-face courses. You will log in to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kcc.instructure.com/">Canvas</a> using your KCC username and password. When you log in for the first time, you will see an invitation to take the Canvas student orientation course. You can click on the announcement or the Help link in the lower left corner of the Canvas screen at any time to enroll.</p>
          <h5 class="typography-h5">Will lab and technology fees still be charged when they are delivered online?</h5>
          <p>Yes, lab and technology fees will be assessed for summer classes because the college still incurs a cost to present coursework and assignments through remote learning.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Are college events affected?</h5>
          <p>Yes, the college has canceled or postponed all events until the Illinois' &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo; order is lifted. KCC employees who are the event organizers are responsible for informing guests and attendees that their event has been postponed or canceled. This includes KCC events at off-campus venues.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Is college-related travel affected?</h5>
          <p>All college-sponsored, non-essential travel is suspended until further notice.</p>
          <h5 class="typography__h5">Are counseling services still available to KCC students?</h5>
          <p>Yes, Transformative Growth Counselors are available via SKYPE and/or phone conferencing. &nbsp;Call 630-423-6010 or visit the website <a target="_blank" href="http://www.transformativegrowth.org">www.transformativegrowth.org</a>. Tell them you are a KCC student.</p>
          <p>Additional referral resources are on the <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/students/advising/Pages/counseling-and-referral-services.aspx">Counseling and Referral Services page</a>.</p>
          <h5 class="typography-h5">Will KCC still accept deliveries and mail while its facilities are closed?</h5>
          <p>Yes, we are receiving mail regularly. We will process all incoming items &mdash; such as payments to vendors and donations to the KCC Foundation as quickly as possible. <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/Community/Collegeinfo/consumer-info/Documents/freedom-of-information-act-form-for-website-2-0.pdf">FOIA</a> requests will be addressed as soon as it is practical.</p>
