          <h2 class="typography__h2">FAQ</h2>
          <p>These questions and answers are specific to KCC. For information about coronavirus, please visit the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>
          <h3 class="typography-h3">Vaccination &amp; mask policy questions</h3>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Who has to be vaccinated to visit KCC?</h4>
          <p>Those who are inside a college facility for more than 15 minutes at least once a week on a regular basis, including students and employees, must provide proof of vaccination. Not included: Individuals who complete their coursework exclusively remotely. This policy goes into effect Sept. 19, 2021.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">What if I do not want to be vaccinated (or cannot) due to medical or other reasons?</h4>
          <p>If you do not receive the vaccine, you must be tested for COVID-19 at least once per week when testing becomes available at KCC. Implementation of the testing is in the works, and will be complete as soon as possible. If there is a gap between the governor's deadline and when testing becomes available, you <strong>can still come to the college</strong> during that time. After being offered at the Riverfront Campus, testing will later expand to extension centers.&nbsp;</p>
          <h5 class="typography-h5">If I'm not vaccinated, can I still come to the college?</h5>
          <div>Yes, during any gap between the governor's deadline and when the college can establish testing, you can come to the college even if you are not vaccinated.&nbsp; Everyone who comes to campus should continue to <a href="https://certify.kcc.edu">certify</a>, social distance and wear masks.</div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">How do I complete the weekly test requirement?</h4>
          <p>Details of how to follow the weekly testing protocol are in the works. They will be communicated as soon as they become available. KCC is contracting with a third party vendor to provide saliva-based PCR tests. You will need to refrain from eating, drinking, or using tobacco for one hour prior to providing your sample.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Is there a charge for the weekly test?</h4>
          <p>No. The testing will be free.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Are my results private?</h4>
          <p>You will have access to your results in a secure web portal. If you are a KCC student or employee, your results will be shared with the college for contact tracing purposes only.&nbsp;</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Can I get tested if I am vaccinated and/or do not have symptoms?</h4>
          <p>Yes. The KCC testing program will be available to anyone regardless of symptoms.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">The deadline to receive a COVID-19 vaccination was extended. What does that mean for me?</h4>
          <p>Other than a change to the deadline, there are no other changes to the policy. Students and employees still need to make plans to get vaccinated or test weekly for COVID-19.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">What is KCC's mask policy?</h4>
          <p><a href="/Mask-required-August2021.pdf">Masks are required</a> in indoor public spaces for everyone, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.&nbsp;</p>
          <h3 class="typography-h3">General questions</h3>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Is campus open?</h4>
          <p>All college facilities are open.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Before every visit to the college&mdash;or upon entering a college building&mdash;students should complete a self-assessment. The self-assessment is at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://certify.kcc.edu">certify.kcc.edu</a>.</li>
            <li>Effective Aug. 11, 2021,<a href="/Mask-required-August2021.pdf"> masks are required</a> for everyone in indoor public spaces, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.</li>

          </ul>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Are classes online or in-person?</h4>
          <p>For the most part, KCC will is back to it's normal schedule. In-person, online and a "hybrid" of both are being offered. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.kcc.edu/schedule">class schedule</a> has details on how each class is being offered.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Where do I ask questions about taking classes online?</h4>
          <p>Canvas is the learning management system used for KCC's online, hybrid and enhanced face-to-face courses. To learn how a course using Canvas works: log in to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kcc.instructure.com/">Canvas</a> using your KCC username and password. When you log in for the first time, there is an invitation to take the Canvas student orientation course. Click on the announcement or the Help link in the lower left corner of the Canvas screen at any time to enroll.</p>
          <p>Also note, lab and technology fees are the same for online and in-person classes because the college still incurs a cost to present coursework &mdash; whether it is in person or through remote learning.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Are counseling services still available to KCC students?</h4>
          <p>Yes, Transformative Growth Counselors are available. &nbsp;Call 630-423-6010 or visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.transformativegrowth.org">www.transformativegrowth.org</a>. Tell them you are a KCC student.</p>
