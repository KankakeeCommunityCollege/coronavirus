        <p>These questions and answers are specific to KCC. For information about coronavirus, please visit the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>
        <h5 class="typography__h5">Is campus still open?</h5>
        <p>Yes. KCC's Riverfront Campus and its extension sites will remain open. Student support services like tutoring, advising, registration, food pantry, computer labs, and campus resources are still available. While on campus, please practice social distancing guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control defines social distancing as "remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet) from others when possible."</p>
        <h5 class="typography__h5">Can I borrow a computer?</h5>
        <p>Yes. The college has a limited supply of computers to loan to students who don't have technology at home. We also can loan internet connectivity equipment to temporarily deliver internet to you. Talk to your advisor if you need these things.</p>
        <h5 class="typography__h5">What if I don't know how to take classes online?</h5>
        <p>You can take an orientation course to learn about Canvas, the learning management system (LMS) used for KCC's online, hybrid and enhanced face-to-face courses. You will log in to <a href="https://kcc.instructure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canvas</a> using your KCC username and password. When you log in for the first time, you will see an invitation to take the Canvas's student orientation course. You can click on the announcement or the Help link in the lower left corner of the Canvas screen at any time to enroll.</p>
        <h5 class="typography__h5">Are college events affected?</h5>
        <p>Yes, the college has canceled all events where at least 50 people were expected. KCC employees who are the event organizers are responsible for informing guests and attendees that their event has been postponed or canceled. This includes KCC events at off-campus venues.</p>
        <h5 class="typography__h5">Will spring semester be a week longer because of the extended spring break?</h5>
        <p>No. There are no plans to extend the semester.</p>
        <h5 class="typography">Will my class (including clinical or lab class) continue?</h5>
        <p>Your professor/instructor will contact you regarding each class. Some will move to an online environment. Depending on the subject matter, some classes such as labs and clinicals will still have some in-person meetings.</p>
        <h5 class="typography__h5">Is college-related travel affected?</h5>
        <p>Yes. Effective immediately, all college-sponsored, non-essential travel is suspended until further notice. There are a few exceptions for previously planned athletic events.</p>
