          <h3 class="typography-h3">Vaccination &amp; testing policy questions</h3>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Who has to be vaccinated to visit KCC?</h4>
          <p>Those who are inside a college facility for more than 15 minutes at least once a week on a regular basis, including students and employees, must provide proof of vaccination. Not included: Individuals who complete their coursework exclusively remotely. This policy goes into effect Sept. 19, 2021.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">What if I do not want to be vaccinated (or cannot) due to medical or other reasons?</h4>
          <p>If you do not receive the vaccine, you must be tested for COVID-19 at least once per week. Chicago Loop Medical is providing testing for students Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Appointments are required. Make appointments and access your results through Loop Medical Center&rsquo;s secure and HIPPA-approved&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://loop.labsvc.net/patientportal/index.html?kcc">Web portal</a>. When you complete the weekly test at KCC, the results are automatically shared with KCC.</p>
          <p><strong>*Please note*&nbsp;</strong>You are&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;required to submit a credit card or have insurance/proof of insurance to test at KCC.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">What if I don&rsquo;t want to test at KCC or miss out when the testing is available at KCC?</h4>
          <p>If you do not complete a COVID-19 test at KCC, you are required to test with a reputable third party (such as the health department or a local pharmacy) and submit results every week by Saturday at 11:59 p.m. Options are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/testing.html">available here</a>.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Am I allowed to test elsewhere?</h4>
          <p>Yes. You still need to provide your results each week. Check your KCC email for the link to submit results.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Is there a charge for the weekly test?</h4>
          <p>No. The testing is free and offered as a service to students. You are&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;required to submit a credit card or have insurance/proof of insurance to test at KCC.</p>
          <h5 class="typography-h5">The website says I need insurance and a credit card?</h5>

          <h5 class="typography-h5"><strong>Do testing appointments fill up?</strong></h5>
          <p>No, Loop Medical will always take walk-ins. More than 100 students can test every hour.</p>
          <h5 class="typography-h5">Where do I upload my results?</h5>
          <p>When you test at KCC, your results are uploaded automatically. When you test at another provider, you should upload your results using the link sent to your KCC student email account.&nbsp;</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Are my results private?</h4>
          <p>When you use the Chicago Loop Medical testing at KCC, you have access to your results in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://loop.labsvc.net/patientportal/index.html?kcc">secure web portal</a>. If you are a KCC student, your results will be shared with the college for contact tracing purposes only.&nbsp;</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Can I get tested if I am vaccinated and/or do not have symptoms?</h4>
          <p>Yes. The KCC testing program is available to all students regardless of symptoms.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">The deadline to receive a COVID-19 vaccination was extended. What does that mean for me?</h4>
          <p>Other than a change to the deadline, there are no other changes to the policy. Students and employees still need to make plans to get vaccinated or test weekly for COVID-19.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">What is KCC's mask policy?</h4>
          <p><a href="/Mask-required-August2021.pdf">Masks are required</a> in indoor public spaces for everyone, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.&nbsp;</p>
          <h5 class="typography-h5">Where can I find COVID-19 testing and/or vaccination sites?</h5>
          <p>The COVID-19 Resources page has links to help, including testing locations <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid-19-testing-sites">throughout Illinois</a> and in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kankakeehealth.org/covid-19-response-and-recovery/covid-19-testing-locations/">Kankakee County</a>; and a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vaccines.gov/search/">searchable database of vaccination locations</a>.</p>

          <h4 class="typography__h5">Is campus open?</h4>
          <p>All college facilities are open.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Before every visit to the college&mdash;or upon entering a college building&mdash;students should complete a self-assessment. The self-assessment is at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://certify.kcc.edu">certify.kcc.edu</a>.</li>
            <li>Effective Aug. 11, 2021,<a href="/Mask-required-August2021.pdf"> masks are required</a> for everyone in indoor public spaces, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.</li>

            <li>General questions can be emailed to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:advising@kcc.edu">advising@kcc.edu</a>.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Are classes online or in-person?</h4>
          <p>For the most part, KCC will is back to it's normal schedule. In-person, online and a "hybrid" of both are being offered. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.kcc.edu/schedule">class schedule</a> has details on how each class is being offered.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Where do I ask questions about taking classes online?</h4>
          <p>Canvas is the learning management system used for KCC's online, hybrid and enhanced face-to-face courses. To learn how a course using Canvas works: log in to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kcc.instructure.com/">Canvas</a> using your KCC username and password. When you log in for the first time, there is an invitation to take the Canvas student orientation course. Click on the announcement or the Help link in the lower left corner of the Canvas screen at any time to enroll.</p>
          <p>Also note, lab and technology fees are the same for online and in-person classes because the college still incurs a cost to present coursework &mdash; whether it is in person or through remote learning.</p>
          <h4 class="typography__h5">Are counseling services still available to KCC students?</h4>
          <p>Yes, Transformative Growth Counselors are available. &nbsp;Call 630-423-6010 or visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.transformativegrowth.org">www.transformativegrowth.org</a>. Tell them you are a KCC student.</p>
