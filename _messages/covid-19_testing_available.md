Illinois’ Governor requires higher education students who are on campus regularly to either be vaccinated against COVID-19 or to complete a weekly COVID-19 test. The college will follow prescribed measures to ensure the order is followed. 

You can avoid weekly tests if you are vaccinated. Already vaccinated? Please [provide your proof of vaccination](https://form.jotform.com/212384579044965){: target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' } if you have not already done so.
