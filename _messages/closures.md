<p><strong>POSTED ON: 03/16/20</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Dear students,</p>
<p>Effective at the end of the business day tomorrow (March 17), KCC will close all facilities through March 30. The exception is the KCC Hammes Bookstore, which will be open 10 a.m. - 6 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Although there have not been any confirmed cases involving KCC, this action is to reduce potential pathways for community spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
<p>Credit-division instruction is moving online wherever possible, beginning March 23. Each professor/ instructor will communicate with their students regarding how their specific classes will proceed in an online environment. Most professors will contact you using your KCC email address. Clinicals will continue as allowed by the host site. Remote instruction is planned through April 20.</p>
<p>Student support services like tutoring, advising, registration, and counseling are still available online. Please contact your advisor at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:advising@kcc.edu">advising@kcc.edu</a> to set up a conference call. The KCC Food Pantry has care packages available for pick-up through 5 p.m. March 17.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re nervous about taking classes in an online environment, or you don&rsquo;t have the technology or internet connectivity you need, please talk to your advisor as soon as possible. Should you need it, Information Technology Services and the ITS Help Desk can provide <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.kcc.edu/students/helpful/it/Pages/helpdesk.aspx">support for online technologies</a>.</p>
