**POSTED ON: 08/30/21**

Hello,

On Aug. 26, Illinois Gov. Pritzker announced new vaccine requirements for higher education students and employees, including KCC.

To comply with this mandate, KCC will institute the following changes:

- **If you are already vaccinated,** complete KCC's [verification form](https://form.jotform.com/212384579044965){: target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' } online. This is a one-time verification. Please submit verification by Sept. 5, 2021.
- **If you are not already vaccinated,** consider making plans to receive the first dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination series or a single-dose vaccination by Sept. 5, 2021. Second doses of the vaccine must be received within 30 days after the first dose.
- **If you do not receive the vaccine,** you must be tested for COVID-19 once per week when testing becomes available at KCC. The earliest date that KCC will be able to implement testing at the Riverfront Campus is Oct. 11. Testing will later expand to extension centers. That information will be communicated to students and employees as it becomes available.
  - KCC is contracting with a third party vendor to provide saliva-based PCR tests.
  - Details of how to follow the weekly testing protocol are in the works and will be communicated before Oct. 11.
- Most KCC students who are vaccinated qualify for a free class from KCC. This is up to a $495 value. [Full details are here](https://news.kcc.edu/archive/2021/08/02/vaccinated-claim-a-free-class/).
- Regardless of the reason, those who do not provide proof of vaccination will be prevented from entering KCC facilities unless they follow the required testing protocol. 
  - Because of the timeframe when testing can begin at KCC,  the earliest KCC will check tests is the week of Oct. 11.

We realize this is not a simple change for many of you. Thank you for your understanding as we implement these required changes. Information will be kept up-to-date on the [coronavirus.kcc.edu](https://coronavirus.kcc.edu) website. Please send questions using the KCC [Coronavirus contact us form](https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/contact-us/).

Sincerely, <br>
Kankakee Community College
