Hello students,

You may have learned that on Feb. 4, a Sangamon County judge issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting specifically named school districts from requiring students to wear masks as a mitigation strategy to slow the spread of COVID-19 in school settings. The ruling also addresses exclusion and testing protocols. Illinois' governor and attorney general have called for an expedited appeal of the ruling.

Some people have wondered if this judgement means changes to KCC's face mask and vaccination policy. The short answer is "no." The judgeâ€™s order has no impact on higher education institutions, which remain obligated to follow all state-issued COVID-19 mitigation measures. KCC's protocols are described on the [COVID-19 website](https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/).

If changes to KCC's COVID-19 policies are warranted or required, we will get this information to you as quickly as possible.

As always, thank you for demonstrating flexibility and empathy as we address the ever-changing nature of this pandemic and our collective response. 

If you have any have questions about this, you are welcome to use the [KCC COVID-19 contact us form](https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/contact-us/).

Sincerely, \
Kankakee Community College
