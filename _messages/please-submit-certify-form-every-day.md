Hello,

KCC is now asking that students complete the [certify.kcc.edu](https://certify.kcc.edu/) assessment every day, 
whether attending class or not. When your responses on the [certify form](https://certify.kcc.edu/) indicate you 
have a positive COVID-19 test or were in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, it will enable us to 
communicate with your professors and contract tracers if necessary. This will also help us follow procedures set 
forth by the Centers for Disease Control, Illinois Department of Public Health and Kankakee County Health Department.

As a reminder, Information on KCCâ€™s COVID-19 policies and procedures are at 
[coronavirus.kcc.edu](https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/). You must follow the KCC vaccination policy. 
FREE COVID-19 testing is available for KCC students.

Please contact us if you have any questions. You can also use the 
[COVID-19 Contact Us form](https://coronavirus.kcc.edu/contact-us/).

Thank you!
