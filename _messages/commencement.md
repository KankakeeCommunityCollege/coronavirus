<p>Dear KCC Employees and Students,</p>
<p>Commencement is one of the most important events in the academic year, which is why KCC takes such great care to make our commencement ceremony so special. It is our opportunity, as faculty and staff, to recognize all of the hard work that we do to support students as they work through certificate and degree programs. Most importantly, commencement is a chance for us to recognize the success of the many students who have accomplished so much in KCC&rsquo;s classrooms, labs, and clinical sites. It&rsquo;s the special time when students&rsquo; families can share in their success and create memories which have lasting, generational impact on peoples&rsquo; lives.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges for all of us, and the health of our community requires us to change the way we interact with each other. This means that it will be necessary for us to change the way that we practice commencement this year. Be assured that we will celebrate the success of our May graduates, and we will recognize the hard work that KCC employees continue to do to help our students achieve success. But it will look quite different this year as we celebrate these achievements in an online event.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we will have more details to share with you about how we plan to recognize and honor the accomplishments of our graduates online. Though it will be a different kind of commencement than we&rsquo;ve ever done, I assure you that it will be special. Perhaps we will be able to host a traditional commencement in May of 2021, and we will invite all May 2020 graduates to participate in that ceremony as well so that we can honor your achievements in a more traditional setting.</p>
<p>I realize that this isn&rsquo;t the way we planned to host commencement this year. Perhaps now more than ever, we need to celebrate our successes and achievements at the end of a very difficult academic year.</p>
<p>Michael Boyd</p>
