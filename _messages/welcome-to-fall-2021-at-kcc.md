<br>&nbsp;Thank you for enrolling for Fall 2021\!<br>Your KCC education will be a great investment in your future.<br>We are focused on providing you with a quality education and maintaining a healthy learning environment.<br>Here are a few key things to know about Fall 2021:

* Many classes will be in-person. Online and hybrid options are also being offered. If you are not sure about how your class(es) will be held – in-person, online, or a combination – please review your registration statement through my.kcc.edu (choose Self-service) or email advising@kcc.edu.
* Many classes start the week of Aug. 16, and the college is continuing measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. Masks are required in all indoor college spaces, regardless of vaccination status.&nbsp;
* Complete the certify.kcc.edu form each time you enter a college facility.
* Federal funding sources are providing several new ways to lower the costs of tuition and other expenses – even if you have already paid or are using a payment plan. More information is on KCC's newsroom: "Fall 2021 funds for students" and "Vaccinated? Claim a FREE class."
* If you are new to online learning (or want a refresher), visit the Student Passport to Online Learning - it's part of Canvas, the online learning portal. It has information on being successful online, plus videos demonstrating common tasks like submitting homework, checking grades, and posting to a discussion board. A PDF, Getting Started with Canvas in 10 Steps, is also available.
* Take advantage of services to help you succeed – including the library, tutoring, the Hammes Bookstore and advisement services. Most services have in-person and online options.
* Free wi-fi is available at all college locations.
* The coronavirus.kcc.edu site has up-to-date information on all procedures.
* Welcome Back events will be from Aug. 16-24. News.kcc.edu/events has individual events.

Please contact us if you have any questions. We understand individual circumstances are different, and want you to succeed.
