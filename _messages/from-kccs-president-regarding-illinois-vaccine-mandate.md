**POSTED ON: 08/27/21**

Yesterday, Illinois Gov. Pritzker announced new vaccine requirements for higher education students and employees, including KCC.

To comply with the mandate, KCC will be asking you to submit proof of vaccination. If you choose not to become vaccinated by September 5th, you will be required to submit to weekly COVID-19 testing at the college. We're still working out the details of weekly testing, and we will share more details when we are able to do so.

This is certainly not the happiest message I've sent to you. I recognize that you may hold strong opinions regarding Illinois' mandate. But I also know how strong and resilient we have all become over the last two years. We've made it this far through the pandemic by enduring challenges, solving problems, and staying hopeful. \
Maya Angelou wrote this short but powerful insight: "You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them."

There are so many things about this pandemic and Illinois' response to the pandemic that you and I cannot control. In response to these things, I ask you to heed Maya Angelou's advice and decide not to let these things reduce you. We can decide for ourselves not to let things like vaccinations or weekly COVID-19 testing stand in the way of our personal or professional goals. We can decide to be resilient and determined in the face of challenges which seem so substantial in this present time. We can decide to look ahead to better times. I believe that the pandemic will end. When it does, each of us will be standing face-to-face with our future. At that moment, we will know if we've let these current circumstances reduce us, or if we've made a decision to confront those challenges with courage and resilience.

As we approach the mandated deadline of September 5th to become vaccinated or begin weekly testing, I hope you will make the brave choice of remaining enrolled in your classes, standing firm in your position of employment here at the college, and committing to doing everything you can to mitigate the spread of this horrible virus.

This is tough, but I know we'll get through it if we able to encourage each other, extend grace to each other, and always remember that we are all--students and staff--experiencing this together.
