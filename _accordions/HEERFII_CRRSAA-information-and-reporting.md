{: .typography__h4.links__offset}

On December 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSAA) was signed into law. This law established the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF II) which includes aid for students and institutions.

Kankakee Community College will receive $633,577 in HEERF II grant funding to disburse to eligible students.

HEERF II grants can be used for any component of a student’s cost of attendance or for emergency costs due to COVID-19, such as tuition, food, housing, health care (including mental health care) or child care. These expenses had to have been incurred on or after March 13, 2020, the date of the declaration of the national emergency. Please note, in accordance with federal guidelines, Kankakee Community College will prioritize grants to students with exceptional financial need.
