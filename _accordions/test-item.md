We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.

Let all these things just sort of happen. Just let these leaves jump off the brush Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Every day I learn. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose.
