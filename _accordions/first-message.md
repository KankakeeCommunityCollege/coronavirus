Hello:

KCC Spring Break will be here next week. This is a time to get a re-charge, as the semester is now half over. It is also a time for some measure of caution, as we monitor the spread of coronavirus.

It is likely that you already know about the global coronavirus outbreak and its ramifications—including for those considering international travel. Its spread is unpredictable.

At KCC, we are relying on the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (CDC) and the [Illinois Department of Public Health](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/coronavirus){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} for updates and official information. It is subject to change, so please check their websites and other reputable sites for accurate information.

The seasonal flu also is present in many areas. Basic measures remain the best defense against coronavirus, flu, and other communicable diseases:
- Stay home if you’re sick,
- Cover coughs and sneezes,
- Clean frequently touched surfaces, and
- Wash your hands often - with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds

At this time, traveling abroad has a number of potential risks. A country not currently experiencing an outbreak could soon be declared a high-risk area, The college strongly recommends not traveling to locations with CDC or State Department Level 3 alerts or higher.

If you are traveling internationally, the [CDC travel information website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} has more information. The State Department’s [STEP program webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/step.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} has searchable alerts and the option to sign up for alerts.

As always, please take your health and safety seriously, be prepared for changing conditions, and anticipate potential problems that may arise. At the same time, it is advised that you be calm and rational in your approach to your day-to-day activities.

All of us at KCC hope that you have a safe, healthy, and rejuvenating break.
