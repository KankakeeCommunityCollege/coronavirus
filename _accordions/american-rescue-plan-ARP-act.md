#### What is a HEERF III Grant and how can it be used?
{: .typography__h4 }

On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP). The ARP appropriated funds for the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) and represents the third stream of funding appropriated for HEERF, designating these funds as HEERF III. 

HEERF III funding can be used for any component of a studentâ€™s cost of attendance or for emergency costs incurred due to COVID-19. This includes tuition and fees, bookstore charges, food, housing, health care (including mental health care), childcare, transportation, and technology. These expenses had to have been incurred on or after March 13, 2020, the date of the declaration of the national emergency. 

Kankakee Community College will receive $3.2 million in HEERF III grant funding to disburse to eligible students. Please note, in accordance with federal guidelines, Kankakee Community College will prioritize students with exceptional financial need.

#### Frequently Asked Questions
{: .typography__h4 }

##### How is HEERF III different from HEERF II?
{: .typography__h5 }

The main difference is the change in eligibility requirements. You are no longer required to be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen to receive funding. All enrolled students are now eligible. This includes citizens, permanent residents, refugees, asylum seekers, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients, other DREAMers, and similar undocumented students.

##### Is there an application required?
{: .typography__h5 }

Yes, a HEERF III application is required. Eligible students should have received an application link to their student email account. You can also access the [HEERF III Application form](https://form.jotform.com/212015939187964){: target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' .btn.btn-primary }.

##### How will I know if I am approved?
{: .typography__h5 }

As soon as your application is reviewed, you will receive an email to your student account notifying you whether your application was approved or denied. Due to a high volume of applications, it may take up to 3 weeks for your application to be reviewed. Monitor your email for notifications, please do not contact our front desk staff to check on your application.

##### Will this funding reduce my financial aid?
{: .typography__h5 }

No, this funding will not impact your financial aid.

##### Can I use a portion of these funds to directly pay my tuition and fees?
{: .typography__h5 }

Yes. You must select the check box on the HEERF III application authorizing KCC to do so. If you are requesting more than the total of your balance, then the remainder of your approved amount will be sent directly to you. If you do not select that check box on the application, then the entirety of your approved amount will be sent directly to you. 

##### How will students receive HEERF III Grant funds?
{: .typography__h5 }

You will be mailed a check to the address on your student account. Checks are processed every other week so it may take 1-3 weeks to receive your check after you have been notified that you were awarded. 

##### Does the money need to be repaid?
{: .typography__h5 }

No, money received through this fund is a grant and does not need to be repaid.
